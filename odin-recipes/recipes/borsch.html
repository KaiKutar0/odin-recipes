                <h3>How To Make Borscht with Meat:</h3>
                <ol style="font-size: 16px;">
                    <li>
                        Wash meat in cold water, cut into 1″ pieces and and place in a large soup pot with 14 cups cold water and 1 Tbsp salt. 
                        Bring it to a boil and remove the foam as soon as it boils (if you wait, 
                        it will be hard to get rid of the foam as it integrates into the broth and you’d have to strain it).
                        Lower the heat, partially cover and cook at a low boil 45 minutes – 1 hr, 
                        periodically skimming off any foam that rises to the top. Sorry, 
                        I forgot to take a picture of the foam. Maybe we’re better off??
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Grate beets on the large grater holes (the food processor works amazingly well). 
                        Place them in a large heavy-bottom skillet with 4 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp vinegar and saute for 5 minutes, 
                        hen reduce heat to med/low and add 1 Tbsp sugar and 2 Tbsp tomato sauce Mix thoroughly and saute until starting to soften, 
                        stirring occasionally (about 10 min). Remove from pan and set aside.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the same skillet (no need to wash it), Saute onion in 1 Tbsp butter for 2 min. 
                        Add grated carrot and sautee another 5 min or until softened, adding more oil if it seems too dry.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the meat has been cooking at least 45 min, 
                        place sliced potatoes into the soup pot and cook 10 min, then add cabbage, sauteed beets, 
                        onion & carrot, and chopped tomatoes. 
                        Cook another 10 minutes or until potatoes can be easily pierced with a fork.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add 2 bay leaves, 1/4 tsp pepper, and more salt to taste (I added another 1/2 tsp salt).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Chop parsley and pressed garlic then stir them into the soup pot, 
                        immediately cover and remove from heat. 
                        Let the pot rest covered for 20 minutes for the flavors to meld.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Borsch with Meat</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                    Borscht is originally Ukrainian but it is made by most Slavic people and is a very common food in Russia. 
                    P.S. The list of ingredients looks lengthy but they are simple. 
                    Serve hot with fresh sprigs of parsley or dill and a dollop of sour cream if desired.
